            In many parts of Africa, brilliant minds are held back not by a lack
            of ambition but by a lack of tools. A laptop, often taken for
            granted elsewhere, remains a luxury for thousands of aspiring
            developers, designers, analysts, and tech innovators. Yet, with the
            right support, these same individuals could lead the future of tech.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">
            That‚Äôs where a Laptop Grant comes in.More than just a device, each
            laptop we provide is a launchpad giving recipients access to online
            courses, career development opportunities, mentorship, and job
            application support. It‚Äôs the difference between being left behind
            and being ready to lead.
          </p>

          <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">
            Take Raymond, for example.
            <br />
            In 2021, Raymond received a laptop through the DTFS Laptop Grant. At
            the time, he was eager to learn but stuck unable to participate
            fully in an edtech course due to lack of access. With the laptop
            came learning. With learning came skill. And by early 2024, Raymond
            landed a role in tech, changing the course of his life, not because
            he got lucky, but because he got the support he needed.
            <em
              >‚ÄúWithout that laptop, I wouldn‚Äôt be where I am today. It was the
              spark I needed to take off.‚Äù ‚Äî
              <strong>Raymond, DTFS Grant Recipient</strong></em
            >
          </p>
          <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">
            Seeing stories like Raymond‚Äôs is what keeps us going. The
            fulfillment we feel when someone prospers that‚Äôs what drives DTFS
            forward. Because we don‚Äôt just fund dreams we help make them real.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">
            It becomes really pertinent to note that Our Laptop Grant is
            designed to support highly motivated individuals who are already
            taking bold steps toward a tech career even without the right
            resources.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">üéØ Who Is Eligible?</p>
          <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">We‚Äôre looking for individuals who:</p>

          <ul style="margin: 0 0 10px 20px">
            <li>
              Have a clear passion for learning and growing in the tech space
            </li>
            <li>
              Can demonstrate progress made without a laptop ‚Äî for example,
              learning on a phone or borrowed device
            </li>
            <li>
              Have saved a small amount toward a laptop, showing intentionality
              and commitment
            </li>
            <li>
              Are enrolled in or preparing to join an edtech course, bootcamp,
              or online program
            </li>
            <li>
              Can provide at least one person who can vouch for them , a mentor,
              tutor, peer, or community leader
            </li>
            <li>
              Are willing to undergo a review and selection process that
              identifies readiness, drive, and growth potential
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">
            This grant is not just about equipment, it's about recognizing drive
            and removing barriers for those already doing their best with the
            little they have.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">
            Take Praise , for example. <br />
            In 2022, She was learning on her phone, doing late-night lessons,
            posting her minor achievements on twitter , struggling with
            visibility, juggling data costs, but still pushing forward. She
            applied for the Laptop Grant, was selected, and in two years, She
            landed a full-time role. The laptop didn‚Äôt make her brilliant, it
            simply unlocked what was already there.
            <br />
            <em
              >‚ÄúI was doing the work before. But when I got the laptop,
              everything changed. It was my turning point.‚Äù ‚Äî

            That‚Äôs what DTFS believes in: backing those who are already moving,
            even if they‚Äôre crawling. If you have the fire, we‚Äôll help you fuel
            it. The impact of every laptop we give is real, and we‚Äôre proud to
            stand behind the next wave of changemakers.

                This scholarship has been nothing short of a miracle for me.
                I‚Äôve dreamt of learning a tech skill, especially UI/UX for so
                long, but the lack of funding made it feel impossible. Just when
                I was about to give up, DevTobs came through like a lifeline.
                You didn‚Äôt just fund my learning, you revived my dream. I‚Äôm
                forever grateful. Thank you, DevTobs, for believing in someone
                like me.

                Before this scholarship, switching into tech felt like a distant
                dream. I knew I wanted to pursue a career in Data Analytics, but
                without the right tools or support, I was stuck. Getting the
                DevTobs scholarship changed everything; it gave me the chance to
                finally get a laptop and opened doors to resources, materials,
                and even more opportunities to grow, learn, and earn. This
                wasn‚Äôt just funding, it was a real breakthrough for me. Thank
